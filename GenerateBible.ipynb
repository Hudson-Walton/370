    "The goal of this notebook is to break the Bible into 66 different books, and use NLTK's generate to produce a generation on all 66 books of the Bible, then compiling to end up with a completely generated Bible.\n",

    "Throughout this project I learned a good bit about spliting texts, because splitting the Bible into 66 different books was quite the challeng. I also tried to make a topic model, but I was having a ton of issues and I could not figure out what I was doing. I ended up getting something to run at the end, but I have no idea what it means, and when I created a dataframe the shape of it was all wrong. I could not figure out where to go from there and everything kept breaking, so I eventually gave up and just left what I had.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original goal for my project was a complete success though. I was able to sucesssfully split 4 different versions of the bible into 66 books each, and then run NLTKs generate on every one of them. The results where as wacky as I excpected, and the generated mini Bibles made absolutely no sense. I had a good bit of fun working on this project."
